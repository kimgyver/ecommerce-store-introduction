# Ecommerce Platform Progress & Key Features

---

## Project Overview

The Ecommerce Platform is a new shopping website designed for both B2B (distributors) and B2C (general customers). Each distributor can operate an independent online store with their own brand and domain, while general customers can conveniently purchase products as well.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Customer Type Recognition

- When a user logs in, their email domain is used to automatically distinguish between distributor and general customer.
- Distributor customers receive custom pricing, discounts, and exclusive services.
- General customers purchase at standard prices.

### 2. Custom Pricing & Discounts

- Each distributor can have different prices and discount rates.
- Additional discounts are available for bulk purchases.
- All pricing policies are managed directly by the admin.

### 3. Order & Quote System

- Sales reps can quickly request quotes using the input UI on the product detail page.
- Official orders (PO) are created directly from the cart, and order details and status can be checked on the admin.
- Automatic email notifications are sent after orders.

### 4. Payment Methods

- General customers pay instantly via credit card (Stripe).
- Distributor customers can use 30-day deferred payment (invoice) as well.
- On supported browsers/devices, wallets like **Google Pay / Apple Pay** can also be available through Stripe (requires HTTPS + domain registration).

### 4.1 Product discovery & navigation (Storefront)

- The storefront product list (`/products`) supports category browsing with a category tree and URL-synced filters (bookmark/share friendly).
- The header search uses a full-screen search modal with live suggestions.

### 5. White-label (Branded Storefronts)

- Each distributor can operate their store with their own domain and branding (logo, color).
- Even for the same product, price, discount, and design may differ by distributor.
- Example: chromet.com/shop → Chromet branding, pizazzstore.com → Pizazz branding

### 6. Admin

- Admins can easily manage orders, sales, payments, products, and settings.
- All orders, quotes, and payment history are visible at a glance.
- **Product operations (admin)** are also included:
  - **Visibility status**: `draft / active / archived` (storefront shows active only)
  - **Inventory adjustments with audit logs**: adjust stock by delta (+/-) with a reason (Inventory History)
  - **Scheduled promotions**: multiple scheduled sales per product (time window, priority, enabled); the effective sale is selected automatically by rule

### 6.1 Operational Settings (Admin)

- Admin can update operational values such as minimum order total, default shipping fee, free-shipping threshold, and low-stock threshold.
- For PoC/operations, the admin email recipient (`ADMIN_EMAIL`) for PO/Quote/test emails can be configured.
- (Extensible) Email sender (From name/domain) and company info for PDFs (address/support email) can also be managed via Settings.

### 6.2 Inventory Operations (Low-stock report + bulk stock update via CSV)

- View low-stock items using a configurable threshold and export results as CSV.
- Upload a CSV (`sku,stock,reason,note`) to bulk update inventory as absolute stock values, with adjustment logs recorded for auditability.

### 6.3 Order CSV Export + fulfillment/tracking fields

- Export orders to CSV for operations/accounting/logistics workflows (one row per order item).
- Store and manage carrier + tracking number, and capture shipped/delivered timestamps when updating fulfillment status.
- (Bulk) Upload a CSV to batch update carrier/tracking and fulfillment status for logistics operations.

### 7. Customer Support (Tickets)

- Customers can contact support from the order detail page and track all inquiries in a dedicated ticket list.
- CS agents manage tickets in an admin queue and respond via a conversation thread (messages).
- Tickets can be linked to an order, allowing agents to review order context while replying.

### 8. Automated Email Notifications

- Automatic emails are sent for all major events such as orders, quotes, and shipping.
- Payment due reminders are also sent automatically.

### 9. Security & Role-based Access

- All users log in securely, and access permissions are set according to their role.
- Distributor staff, admins, and general customers each see only the features they need.
