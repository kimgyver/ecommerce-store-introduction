## Key Test Scenarios

> **To test both frontend (user) and admin at the same time:**
>
> - Only one account can be logged in per browser session.
> - To test both at once, use a different browser or a private/incognito window for each.

### [Common] Sign Up & Login

- Click the login/sign up button at the top right to create a new account or log in with the test accounts above.

### 1. General User Experience

- Browse products, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.
- Try the Stripe credit card payment flow (test cards supported).
- Check order history, request quotes, and experience automated email notifications.
- **Customer Support (Tickets)**
  - After placing an order, open the **order detail page** and click `Contact Support` to create a ticket.
  - Use the user menu `Customer Support` to view your ticket list, ticket detail, and threaded replies from support.

### 2. Distributor Experience

- Log in as a distributor to see custom pricing, discounts, and a dedicated dashboard.
- Test B2B features like bulk discounts, 30-day deferred payment (PO), and quote requests.
- You can request a quote directly from the input UI located in the middle of each product detail page.
- Branding (logo/color) per distributor is implemented, but actual application is based on subdomain routing.
- Since the PoC demo site uses a single domain, automatic brand design application cannot be directly experienced.

### 3. Admin Experience

- Log in as admin to manage all orders, users, products, distributors, pricing, and branding.
- Explore advanced features like white-label management, distributor pricing/discount/domain settings, and automated email templates.
- **Product operations (recommended test points)**
  - On `/admin/products`, verify product status (`draft/active/archived`) and see **current price/sale + Next price (next effective price/time)**.
  - On product detail (`/admin/products/[id]`):
    - In `Scheduled Sales`, try **Add / Edit / Delete** and observe how the `Current/Next (effective)` summary changes.
    - In `Inventory History`, adjust stock by **delta (+/-) + reason** and verify the audit log is recorded.
- **Customer Support (Ticket Queue)**
  - Visit `/admin/support-tickets` to manage the support ticket queue, update status, add internal notes, and reply via a threaded conversation.
  - If a ticket is linked to an order, use the `Show Order` toggle in the ticket detail page to view an order summary without leaving the ticket.
- Note: Some advanced features (e.g., direct email template editing, full white-label design automation, fully independent distributor admin modules) may be limited or partially implemented in this PoC. Most admin features can be tested with the admin@test.com account.

- Admin settings: In the Admin UI under **Settings**, you can set the test recipient for PO/Quote emails (key: `ADMIN_EMAIL`).

## Additional Notes

- The PoC site is for testing only; no real payments or shipping will occur.
- If you have questions or encounter issues, please contact us anytime.
- Feel free to try different roles and create new accounts for testing.

### Email Notification Guide

- For all major events (order, quote, shipping, etc.), notification emails are sent to the email address you registered with.
- For admin testing, set your own email as `ADMIN_EMAIL` in the Admin UI **Settings** to receive test notification emails directly.
- Please also check your spam/junk folder (especially for Gmail and similar services).

### Stripe Test Card Information

- For payment testing, use the following Stripe test card:
  - Card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
  - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
  - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
  - Postal code: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
- No real payment will be processed, so you can test safely.
