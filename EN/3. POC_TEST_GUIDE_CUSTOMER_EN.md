## Key Test Scenarios

> **To test both frontend (user) and admin at the same time:**
>
> - Only one account can be logged in per browser session.
> - To test both at once, use a different browser or a private/incognito window for each.

### [Common] Sign Up & Login

- Click the login/sign up button at the top right to create a new account or log in with the test accounts above.

### 1. General User Experience

- Browse products, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.
- Try the Stripe credit card payment flow (test cards supported).
- (Optional) If your browser/device supports it, try **Google Pay / Apple Pay** in checkout. Wallet availability depends on browser/device, HTTPS, and Stripe domain registration.
- Check order history, request quotes, and experience automated email notifications.
- **Customer Support (Tickets)**
  - After placing an order, open the **order detail page** and click `Contact Support` to create a ticket.
  - Use the user menu `Customer Support` to view your ticket list, ticket detail, and threaded replies from support.

- Product discovery UX test (recommended)
  - Open **Products** and do category tree navigation (left sidebar on desktop)
  - Search (sticky bar) and URL-synced filters (bookmark/share friendly)
  - Header search modal (search icon) for live suggestions

### 2. Distributor Experience

- Log in as a distributor to see custom pricing, discounts, and a dedicated dashboard.
- Test B2B features like bulk discounts, 30-day deferred payment (PO), and quote requests.
- You can request a quote directly from the input UI located in the middle of each product detail page.
- Branding (logo/color) per distributor is implemented, but actual application is based on subdomain routing.
- Since the PoC demo site uses a single domain, automatic brand design application cannot be directly experienced.

### 3. Admin Experience

- Log in as admin to manage all orders, users, products, distributors, pricing, and settings.

- **Home landing page layout** : In the Admin sidebar, open **Home Page** menu
  - Edit the Home landing layout JSON (`heroTiles`, `featuredSections`)
  - Use **Format** and **Validate** before saving
  - Save, then open the storefront homepage (`/`) to verify layout changes
  - (Advanced) Use “Check homepage config” to sanity-check images/sections if needed

- **Product operations (recommended test points)**
  - In the Admin sidebar, open **Products** and verify product status (`draft/active/archived`) and **current price/sale + Next price (next effective price/time)**.
  - In **Products → a specific product detail page**:
    - In `Scheduled Sales`, try **Add / Edit / Delete** and observe how the `Current/Next (effective)` summary changes.
    - In `Inventory History`, adjust stock by **delta (+/-) + reason** and verify the audit log is recorded.
- **Customer Support (Ticket Queue)**
  - In the Admin sidebar, open **Support Tickets** to manage the queue, update status, add internal notes, and reply via a threaded conversation.
  - If a ticket is linked to an order, use the `Show Order` toggle in the ticket detail page to view an order summary without leaving the ticket.

#### Advanced (optional)

- White-label management, distributor pricing/discount/domain settings, and other advanced admin features
- Note: Some advanced features (e.g., full white-label design automation, fully independent distributor admin modules) may be limited or partially implemented in this PoC.

- Admin settings: In the Admin UI under **Settings**, you can set the test recipient for PO/Quote emails (key: `ADMIN_EMAIL`).
- Operational settings test:
  - In the Admin sidebar, open **Settings** and update **minimum order total / default shipping fee / free-shipping threshold / low-stock threshold**
  - Verify the storefront Cart/Checkout reflects the updated values (shipping fee and minimum order validation).
- Inventory operations test:
  - In the Admin sidebar, open **Inventory** to review the low-stock report and export it as CSV.
  - Download the template CSV and upload `sku,stock,reason,note` to bulk update stock, then verify per-row results and adjustment logs.
- Order operations test:
  - In the Admin sidebar, open **Orders** and run Order CSV export (with date filters) and confirm it exports one row per order item.
  - In **Orders → order detail**, set carrier/tracking number and change status to shipped/delivered to confirm shipped/delivered timestamps are recorded.
  - (Bulk) In **Orders → Operations → Bulk fulfillment update (CSV)**, upload carrier/tracking in batch.
  - On the storefront order detail page, confirm **Track shipment** link and **Shipping fee** are shown.

## Additional Notes

- The PoC site is for testing only; no real payments or shipping will occur.
- If you have questions or encounter issues, please contact us anytime.
- Feel free to try different roles and create new accounts for testing.

### Email Notification Guide

- For all major events (order, quote, shipping, etc.), notification emails are sent to the email address you registered with.
- For admin testing, set your own email as `ADMIN_EMAIL` in the Admin UI **Settings** to receive test notification emails directly.
- Please also check your spam/junk folder (especially for Gmail and similar services).

### Stripe Test Card Information

- For payment testing, use the following Stripe test card:
  - Card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
  - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
  - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
  - Postal code: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
- No real payment will be processed, so you can test safely.
